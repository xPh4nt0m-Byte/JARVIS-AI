"""
Steam and Epic control for JARVIS — installing, updating, and reporting.

WHY THIS WAS REWRITTEN

    The previous version drove Steam by guessing. It looked for a separate
    top-level window titled "install", matched button text against a list of
    English and Turkish words, and picked the login profile by screenshotting
    the window and clicking the first colourful blob of pixels. Every one of
    those assumptions is now measurably wrong, and each was costing seconds:

    THE INSTALL DIALOG IS NOT A WINDOW. Measured: triggering steam://install
    and watching for ten seconds produced NO new top-level window. Modern Steam
    draws the install dialog as a modal INSIDE the main window. The old search
    could therefore never find it, and paid `40 x 0.5s` — twenty seconds — to
    discover that, before falling through to clicking at hardcoded percentages
    of the window's width and height.

    THE WINDOW DOES NOT BELONG TO steam.exe. Measured: the login window and
    the main window are both class `SDL_app`, owned by `steamwebhelper.exe`.
    So `steam.exe` being in the task list proves only that Steam is loading —
    NOT that anybody is logged in. That is the whole "it just sits there on
    the profile screen" complaint: the old code saw its process, declared
    success and moved on to a client that was still asking who was playing.

    THE TREE IS THERE, IT IS JUST ASLEEP. Steam's UI is Chromium, and Chromium
    builds its accessibility tree ONLY once something asks for it. Measured on
    the login window: the first FindAll returned 0 elements in 0.061s; a second
    query moments later returned 35. A single query that gives up on the first
    empty answer will conclude — wrongly, and every time — that Steam exposes
    nothing and that pixels are the only way in. So the first query here is a
    WAKE-UP, and an empty answer is retried rather than believed.

    Once awake, everything needed is simply readable, and fast:

        full tree scan of the Steam window       0.030 - 0.077 s
        Invoke() on a profile / a button         0.013 - 0.015 s

    Invoke is not a click. The mouse does not move, the window is not raised,
    and the user's foreground app keeps focus — which matters because these
    calls happen while somebody is talking to JARVIS.

WHAT THAT BUYS

    THE RIGHT PROFILE, NOT THE FIRST ONE. The login screen exposes each
    account as a Hyperlink next to a Text reading "Account name: <login>", and
    `config/loginusers.vdf` on disk says which account has AutoLogin set. The
    two are matched, so the account that Steam itself would have chosen is the
    one pressed. Nothing is recognised by colour, and nothing is recognised by
    English.

    THE RIGHT DRIVE, FOR A REASON. The old code scanned every drive letter and
    took whichever had the most room free — including drives with no Steam
    library on them, which the dialog does not even offer. The real libraries
    are listed in `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf`; measured on this machine that
    is `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam` with 3.7 GB free and `F:\\SteamLibrary`
    with 54.9 GB. The dialog states the download size itself ("30.59 GB"), so
    the choice is made against the number that actually decides it, and the
    result is VERIFIED by re-reading the dialog rather than assumed.

    AN HONEST ANSWER. StateFlags is a BIT FIELD and the old code compared it
    for equality — `state == 4`, `state == 1026`. A game sitting at 68 or 1030
    was invisible to all of it. Bits are tested as bits now, and because
    `BytesDownloaded` and `BytesToDownload` are in the manifest too, "is it
    downloading" can be answered with a percentage and a remaining size instead
    of a name.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO

    It will not press Install for a game whose download does not fit anywhere.
    It says which drive, how much is needed and how much is free, and stops.
    Filling a system drive is not a thing to be brisk about.

    This is the difference between reporting what was pressed and reporting
    what happened. The manifest appears within a second or two of a real
    install, and it also says which library the game went into, which is the
    only trustworthy answer to "where is it installing".

    Watching the screen at the same time is what stops the other outcome being
    described as a mystery. Measured: a game whose publisher requires a licence
    agreement puts that agreement up INSTEAD of starting, and waiting the full
    timeout to then say "Steam has not reported a download yet" describes the
    one thing on screen as an absence.

    window between the install dialog and the licence that follows it — the
    handle captured a second earlier is dead, and a dead handle makes every
    scan return nothing. Measured with a handle held across that change: the
    agreement sat on screen for the whole fifteen seconds and none of the
    thirty-odd scans saw it, while the same call against a freshly-found window
