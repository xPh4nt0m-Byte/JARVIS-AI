"""
telegram_remote.py — drive JARVIS from anywhere, over Telegram.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The Remote Dashboard already relays typed commands into the Live session
    (dashboard/server.py -> main.py _process_dashboard_commands), but it is a
    LAN thing: it binds a local IP, generates a self-signed certificate and even
    opens a firewall rule. Outside the house it is unreachable.

    Telegram solves exactly the missing half. This plugin LONG-POLLS Telegram's
    servers (getUpdates) — so there is no inbound port, no port forwarding, no
    NAT traversal and no certificate warning. The only socket ever opened is an
    outbound HTTPS connection to api.telegram.org.

    No new dependency: `requests` is already in requirements.txt.

HOW A MESSAGE BECOMES A COMMAND
    Telegram message -> allowlist + freshness + rate checks -> player.on_text_command()
    -> main.py::_on_text_command -> session.send_client_content(). That is the
    same door the desk text box uses, so a remote command behaves identically to
    one typed at the machine — including every tool, guard and undo entry.

NO KEYWORD, IN ANY LANGUAGE, DECIDES ANYTHING HERE
    This project is used in dozens of languages, so the dispatch path contains
    no natural-language matching at all. There are exactly three ways in, and
    the third is really the first with a microphone in front of it:

      1. Free text. Anything that is not a slash command goes STRAIGHT to the
         model, in whatever language it was written. The model reads the English
         JSON schema below, decides what was asked for, and fills in `action`.
         "ekranı gönder", "schick mir den Bildschirm" and "screenshot please"
         all arrive at action="screenshot" without this file knowing a word of
         any of them.

      2. Slash commands. Language-neutral protocol tokens (/screen, /sys) that
         skip the model entirely when you want the answer in one second rather
         than one round trip. They are not words; they are buttons that happen
         to be spelled.

      3. A voice note. Turned into words first and then treated exactly as if
         they had been typed — including being shown back to you before anything
         acts on them, because recognition is never perfect and a remote command
         heard wrong and run in silence is the one failure this could not
         survive. Which recogniser does it is NOT a new setting: it follows the
         one already made in ENGINE & PROVIDERS, so a person who moved to a
         local pipeline to keep their audio on the machine does not have it
         posted to Google by a plugin they added for something else.

    The first two are generated from ONE table — _OPS, below — which is also
    what builds the tool declaration, the Telegram command menu, the phone
    keyboard and /help. Four consumers, one declaration, nothing written twice.

IT ONLY LISTENS WHEN YOU SAY SO
    Plugins have no startup hook, and a remote-control channel is the last thing
    that should open because a file was in a folder. "Start the Telegram remote"
    starts it, the same way water_reminder and whatsapp_guard start their loops.

    There is a switch that changes this — START LISTENING WHEN JARVIS LAUNCHES —
    and it is OFF until somebody at the computer turns it on. That distinction
    is the whole of it: the default is still that downloading this file gives
    nobody a listening bot, and turning it on is a deliberate act performed at
    the machine by the person who owns it. Nothing reachable from Telegram can
    flip it, so a phone still cannot arrange for its own way back in.

SECURITY — WHAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS YOU
    1. Allowlist.       Only chat IDs you approved are obeyed. Everything else is
                        dropped in silence — a stranger who guesses the bot never
                        even learns it is alive. The bot's command menu is
                        registered per approved chat, so an unapproved one sees
                        no menu either: the bot looks like it does nothing.
    2. Pairing window.  Pairing is not permanently open. It arms for 10 minutes,
                        either at start when no chat is approved yet, or when you
                        ask for it at the desk — and it closes on the first
                        success, on the clock, or after 10 wrong codes anywhere.
                        The budget is GLOBAL: a limit counted per chat is no
                        limit at all when the attacker picks a new chat each try.
    3. Pairing code.    An unknown chat becomes allowed ONLY by sending the code
                        you set, compared in constant time on the UTF-8 bytes and
                        consumed on first use. Case and accents are reduced first
                        — phone keyboards capitalise, and a silent mismatch on a
                        setup step is unfixable by the person hitting it.
    4. Rate limit.      20 messages per minute per chat, applied BEFORE the
                        allowlist is consulted, so pairing attempts are counted
                        too. (They were not, in the first version, which made the
                        pairing code the one wall with no limiter behind it.)
    5. Private only.    Groups, channels, bots and edited messages are refused.
                        An edited old message can never re-fire a command.
    6. Start floor.     Nothing sent before the bridge started is ever executed —
                        compared against Telegram's own timestamps, so it holds
                        even when the backlog drop below fails. That mattered:
                        the drop is one HTTP call, and a failed call used to
                        leave the whole queue eligible without saying so.
    7. Backlog drop.    Belt to the floor's braces: the webhook is deleted with
                        drop_pending_updates and the update offset jumps past
                        everything already queued.
    8. Freshness.       A message older than 2 minutes is refused — measured
                        against TELEGRAM's clock, learned from the Date header of
                        short requests, because a computer whose clock is wrong
                        would otherwise reject everything.
    9. Turn-bound replies. Answers go back only to the chat that asked, and only
                        for the turn it triggered — the window closes on quiet,
                        not on a stopwatch. Your desk conversation, a morning
                        briefing or a background alert that happens to land a
                        minute later is NOT mirrored to your phone.
   10. The phone cannot widen its own permissions. The screen, the camera, the
                        folder files may be written to and the folder files may
                        be read from are each shut until somebody at the COMPUTER
                        opens them, and no message from Telegram can open any of
                        them — not even by asking the model, which is checked
                        separately on that path. Turning things OFF works from
                        anywhere: /stop and /panic need no permission at all.
                        The asymmetry is the whole design.
   10b. Files stay in their folder. An incoming name is reduced to its last
                        component and stripped, so nothing can be written
                        outside the inbox; an outgoing one is resolved and its
                        parent compared against the shared folder, so no
                        traversal and no symlink can read out of it. Neither
                        folder has a default: unnamed means the feature does
                        not exist.
   11. Token hygiene.   The bot token lives in config/api_keys.json and is NEVER
                        printed: requests puts the URL in its exception text, so
                        every error string is scrubbed before it is logged.
   12. Visible at desk. Every accepted remote command, every picture sent, every
                        file saved or handed out and every refused stranger is
                        written to the activity log. Nothing happens invisibly.
   13. Kill switches.   /stop from an approved chat, /panic to stop AND erase
                        every approved phone in one message, "stop the telegram
                        remote" by voice, or action="unpair" at the desk.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    It does not weaken the confirmation gate. Shutdown, restart and WiFi still
    put a banner on the HUD and wait for a button pressed BY A HAND. Asking for
    them from Telegram tells you the banner is up — and it stays up until someone
    is physically there. That is the correct answer, not a limitation: a remote
    channel must not be able to confirm an irreversible action on its own.

    And it makes no promise it cannot keep: once text reaches the Live session it
    is indistinguishable from text typed at the desk, so this file cannot give
    remote commands a smaller tool set than local ones. What it CAN gate, it
    gates here — at the door, before the model ever sees the request.
