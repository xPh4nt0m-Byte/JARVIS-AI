plugins/_telegram_ops.py — the extra things telegram_remote.py can put on a phone.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
    telegram_remote.py is a security boundary: an allowlist, two replay walls, a
    rate limiter, a pairing budget and a reply window. That file wants to stay
    small enough that somebody can read all of it before trusting it with their
    computer. Screen capture and hardware telemetry are not security; they are
    payload. They live here so the boundary does not grow every time a feature
    is added.

    The leading underscore is load-bearing: core/plugin_loader.py skips `_*.py`,
    so this is never treated as a plugin of its own and costs the model NOTHING
    — no second tool declaration, no extra characters on every connection. It is
    the same arrangement _google_core.py has with the Gmail/Calendar pair.

    Delete this file and the bridge still runs; it simply offers fewer things,
    and says so in a sentence.

WHAT AN "OP" IS
    One capability, declared once, in English, as data:

        action  the value the MODEL writes into its JSON when the user asks for
                this in whatever language they happen to speak
        cmd     a slash token for the phone — a shortcut that skips the model
        desc    one English line, which becomes both the model's schema text and
                the description Telegram shows in the bot's command menu
        where   who may trigger it: the desk, the phone, or both
        gate    a settings toggle that must be ON, or None
        arg     a hint for the one optional argument, or None
        button  whether it earns a place on the phone's thumb keyboard. Anything
                that cannot be taken back should not sit next to something that
                is pressed daily, so this is not simply "is it useful".
        confirm whether it has to be sent twice. The second press is the
                confirmation, which needs no word in any language - see
                preview() below.

    telegram_remote.py merges this tuple with its own and generates the tool
    schema, the Telegram command menu, the phone keyboard and /help from the
    result. Nothing is written down twice, and no natural-language keyword — in
    any language — appears anywhere in the dispatch path.

EVERYTHING HEAVY IS IMPORTED INSIDE A FUNCTION
    Plugin discovery executes telegram_remote.py on every launch, and it imports
    this module. actions/screen_processor.py pulls in numpy and probes for cv2 at
    module scope; mss and Pillow are not free either. None of that may be charged
    to a boot where nobody opens the remote, so this module's own imports are all
    deferred to the moment a picture is actually asked for.
